    I am a graduate student at <a href="https://pma.caltech.edu/people/joonhwi-kim">Caltech</a>,
    working on Scattering Amplitudes.
    I am currently interested in 
    color-kinematics duality,
    twistor theory,
    and quantum field theoretic approaches to general relativity.
    Ultimately, I want to understand how quantum physics reshapes the notion of spacetime.
    I am generally interested in geometrical approaches to physics.
