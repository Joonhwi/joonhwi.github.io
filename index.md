    <!-- I am a student working on theoretical high-energy physics. -->
    I am a graduate student at <a href="https://pma.caltech.edu/people/joonhwi-kim">Caltech</a>,
    working on <em>Scattering Amplitudes</em>.
    <!-- My curiosity points toward understanding the true nature of spacetime. -->
    In a sense, I 
    <!-- identify myself as -->
    am
    a “relativist” learning how to rethink the very notion of spacetime
    and gravity
    from amplitudes in quantum field theory.
    Specifically, my current interests are
    <em>color-kinematics duality</em> and
    <em>twistor theory</em>.
    <!-- Perturbative syntax .. physical reality at the syntactic level -->
    More generally, I
    am
    <!-- have always been -->
    interested in geometrical approaches to physics.
    <!-- interested in the interplay between geometry and physics. -->
    <!-- as a person who thinks with geometrical intution -->
    <!-- More generally, I am interested in geometrical approaches to physics. -->
