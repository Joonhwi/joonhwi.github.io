        I am a PhD student at <a href="https://pma.caltech.edu/people/joonhwi-kim">Caltech</a>,
        thinking about gravity from the angle of scattering amplitudes.
        My interests are
        color-kinematics duality,
        twistor theory,
        problems in general relativity,
        and more generically
        intersections between geometry and physics.
