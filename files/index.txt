    <!-- My curiosity points toward understanding the true nature of spacetime. -->
    In a sense, I 
    <!-- identify myself as -->
    am
    a “relativist” learning how to rethink the very notion of spacetime
    and gravity
    from amplitudes in quantum field theory.
    Specifically, my current interests are
    <em>color-kinematics duality</em> and
    <em>twistor theory</em>.
